While my formal education is is GIS, I have always wanted to be the one making the programs, not using them.  My experience working as a GIS Technician has allowed time and training to make the career change.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To make this change a reality I have been self teaching various coding languages(Python, Javascript.. See spacejunk). I also made the leap into a coding bootcamp called the Software Guild.  I have a write up on each week that goes by, check it out! This site is intended to act as both a Resume and Portfolio of my works.  You can visit my projects page to see products that I have been working on or visit the contact page if you want to get in touch. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

                                    <p>The Software Guild is an immersive 12 week coding bootcamp.  The majority of this bootcamp has a hands on feel which I love. We didn't just learn by reading chapters out of a curriculum, we learned by designing, implementing, and most importantly making mistakes!

                                    I attended the Java cohort which focuses on Java backend Development.  

                                    The first 6 weeks focused on Object Oriented Programming.

                                     The second 6 weeks focused on Data Driven Web Applications.  </p>

                                        Week one was a crash course on basic programming concepts.  We set up our IDE’s, issue tracking, and code review tools.  After we were up and running we dove right into controlling program flow, boolean expressions, methods, arrays, and debugging.  This week of the bootcamp significantly solidified prior programming concepts that I had self taught previously.  

                                        The summative project for this week was to create a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.  This project was intended to be in a single main class with optional methods.  The outut is designed to be printed into the consol.

                            Week two was jokingly referred to as the “face melter week” and it did not disappoint.  This is where my work prior to the bootcamp really payed off.  This week we worked through Object-Orientated Concepts, Classes, and Types, Memory Management, Composition and Inheritance, Data Marshalling, MVC and Tiered Application Design Concepts for CRUD, and Software Development Lifecycles.  
                            <br>
                            Prior to this week I had a good understanding of how writing code works syntactically.  As in I understood how what I had to write to complete a task, not the reason why we wrote the code in such ways.  This week really opened my eyes to the OBJECT in OOP languages and working through Objects.  We also got our first introduction to SOLID.  Specifically the (**Separation of duties**) was a concept that I had been thinking over in my head on how developers executed.(**write MORE on this topic**)
                            <br>
                            The Summative assignment this week was to create our first CRUD console application, an Address Book.  We first designed this program using ((***scratch paper techniques**)).  Then we structured our program into the View, Controller, and Dao (data access object).

                            <h4>Week 3</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>unit testing (stateless and stateful)</li>
                                <li>Enums, JavaDateTime, BigDecimal</li>
                                <li>Lambdas, Streams</li>
                                <li>summative- Vending Machine</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            Week 3 was an intro into using libraries and JavaDocs.  The way this course is set up is that as the weeks go by the instructors will “give” out less information and make the students look it up. So with the introduction to BigDecimal and JavaDateTime we then had to learn implentation through JavaDocs with some instructor assistance.  
                            <br>
                            Alsong with this was our first introduction to unit testing.  This is a powerful tool for testing methods as you build the application.

                            The summative assignment for this week was to create a virtual vending machine.  This still follows a basic CRUD Application.  This week included a service(business logic) layer in our design.  We also had to include a full set of unit testing for our DAO and Service Layers.  We are still using console outputs for this application, UX design comes after week 5.

                            This week we had an introduction to Spring Framework and Maven.  We also had an introduction to Aspect Oreinteated Programming.  
                            * Special Note
                            I had a big blocker this week regarding AOP injections.   My bug was that I was     trying to create a logger every time an exception was thrown.  the method that I was trying to create the point cut on was called inside the object that was calling it.  This call was never captured by the proxy because the method call never left the object.  Overall I spend a lot of time reading through the Docs on AOP and throughout testing my method for a simple fix.  Even though i spent a good amount of time on this I take it as a positive.  I would have never learned the knowledge I have on Spring and AOP without this bug if i wrote my code correct the first time.

                            <p>Space Junk is a concept I designed for self teaching programming.  It is a simple side scroller where the only goal is to pilot your rocket ship as long as possible while avoiding aestroids.  I designed and implented this project using a trial by error approach.  I had not yet completed much serious educaton in coding, I just knew that I wanted to complete the project.

                            All the code for this game is written using UnityScript, a similar dialect to JavaScript.  I designed all of the sprites and graphics using an open source vector graphic editor.  While this specific version is lacking in game content, I designed it so that I can quickly add features in the future.

                                <p>KylePackard.com was originally designed using Wordpress.  While functionally Wordpress is great for this type of website, I wanted to design my own from the ground up.  The result is the website you currently are on.  It is designed using Bootstrap frameworks and jQuery calls.

                                This was my first endevour into web development so I chose a quick platform for release.  This was a great opportinity to dip my feet in web development.  This website is only kept for legacy reasons and will not be updated.</p>
